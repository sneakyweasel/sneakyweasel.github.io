I've been fascinated by quantum physics and especially quantum optics for some time. I've had the opportunity to work with some of the best researchers in the field.

## Quantum error correction

I worked with IBM researchers on the [Decodoku project](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05053.pdf) which uses toric codes for quantum error correction and my use of a custom made genetic algorithm led to the discovery of the "Weasel toric code" algorithm.

## Quantum optics

- I was invited by Artur Ekert at [Centre for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org/) in Singapore to work on the first graphical quantum optics simulator as lead-dev: [Quantum Game](https://quantumgame.io/). Our work is now used by thousands of students and researchers around the world.

- With my team we were finalists for the [Webby's Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webby_Awards), considered to be the "Digital Oscars", for the [best scientific project of 2023](https://www.webbyawards.com/crafted-with-code/virtual-quantum-lab/) competing against NASA Jet Propulsion Lab and OpenAI.

- We also wrote a publication [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13300) about the project and the no-code, no-maths approach to quantum optics and the vizualisation of quantum optics.

## Quantum computing & AI

- I was invited to attend MIT IQuHack 2023, the world's largest quantum hackathon. We did a great project on quantum machine learning and presented a solid project to the jury. [Quintessence](https://github.com/sneakyweasel/quintessence)

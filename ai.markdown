I've been involved in various AI projects since 2016 and passed my [Deep Learning Specialization](https://coursera.org/share/060c260c19a2007f337dfae390fe4382). I've worked on various topics such as:

- ML and DL for NLP
- Generative text with LLMs (GPT-4, Llama-2, Falcon, etc.)
- Generative art using Stable Diffusion
- Advanced prompting
- AI safety and red-teaming
- AI ethics
- Religious AI
- AI hacking and prompt injection techniques
- Deepfakes and GANs

I've been introducing those subjects in high profile conferences such as:

- Sorbonne University (Paris)
- Conf√©rence des Eveques de France
- AI ethics thinktank

I'm a french lead-dev that loves to code and learn new things. I'm currently working as a freelancer for generative AI and LLMs. I'm also a big fan of the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

My various interests are:

- Quantum physics
- Machine learning
- Generative art
- Rust
- Jewelry
- 3D printing
- 3D modeling
- Ironman triathlon

You can check my [Github](https://github.com/sneakyweasel) for more info about my projects.

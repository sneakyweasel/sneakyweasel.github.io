I've been involved in various AI projects since 2016 and got a [Deep Learning Specialization](https://coursera.org/share/060c260c19a2007f337dfae390fe4382) certificate. I've been a public speaker on AI in some influential conferences and I'm currently working as a freelancer for generative AI and LLMs on two large projects.

## Experience

- Applied ML & DL
- GANs and "deepfakes"
- Generative text with LLMs (GPT-4, Llama-2, Falcon, etc.)
- Generative art using Stable Diffusion
- Advanced prompting
- RAG and vector embeddings (structured data)
- AI hacking and prompt injection techniques
- AI safety and red-teaming
- AI ethics and philosophy

## Conferences

Since I studied philosophy & theology for 4 years and I'm now a lead-dev in AI I have a unique perspective on the ethical and philosophical implications of AI.

I've been introducing those subjects in high profile conferences such as:

- Sorbonne University (Paris)
- High level religious conferences (Paris)
- AI ethics thinktank

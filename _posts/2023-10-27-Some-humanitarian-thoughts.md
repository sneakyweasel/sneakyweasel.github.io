I've co-founded 2 large NGOs, [AAAsie](http://actionaideasie.com/) & [AAAfrique](http://actionaideafrique.com/), active in the medical field in emerging countries and I've been involved in various large humanitarian projects since 2000 mostly in India, Vietnam, Cambodia, Burma, Madagascar, Laos, Sri-Lanka, etc.
I have been on more than 50 missions in the field and have gathered a lot of first hand experience about the humanitarian world by building many hospitals, dispensaries and medical centers in remote areas.

## International NGOs and field NGOs

There's often a strong disconnect between international NGOs and local NGOs. International NGOs are often pretty large, operate like business with large administrative costs and are efficient in fundraising, marketing and management. They are often more interested in their own survival and prestige than in the actual humanitarian work.

Local NGOs are small structures that have a strong local knowledge and real active field experience. They are often led by a charismatic leader who carries most of the work on his shoulders. They have close to no reach to funding and are often struggling to survive.

## Local ecosystems and power structure

Worrying levels of healthcare are often a symptom of larger societal problems since healthcare requires a lot of heavy infrastructure and a lot of qualified people. It is often a good indicator of the overall health of a society.

Nature will fill the gaps so if the healthcare system is not working properly people will turn to traditional medicine, witch doctors, etc. which can be a lot worse. "Alternative healthcare" employs a lot of people and creates a whole ecosystem around it.

When you try to fix it coming from outside, you first must understand the whole ecosystem and the local culture, since you will disturb it and create local ennemies on the way. It is crucial to understand and use the local power structure and the local politics.

## Infrastructure

Once you build a hospital or a dispensary it creates a lot of non-medical qualified jobs: technicians, plumbers, caterers, etc. Those are opportunities for the local population and will attract people from the surrounding area. So you must plan for adequate water, electricity, housing, etc.

If your health structure reached a certain size and becomes important in the local heath ecosystem, chances are the state will want to take control of it because of the political power it gives. So you must plan for it and make sure you have a good relationship with the local authorities.

Chances are you will not be able to resist the political takeover, somehow it means that your work has reached its goal and that the local population is now benefiting from it.

## Medical equipment

In western countries with a high level of healthcare there's a lot of medical equipment that is not used anymore because it's been replaced by the latest version and it's still perfectly working. This equipment is often donated to NGOs and sent to emerging countries.

Sometimes local politicians will build a brand new hospital for their prestige which will be empty because the construction is over budget and there's no money left to buy the equipment. So they will ask for donations from international NGOs.

The problem is that most of the time nobody wants to pay for the running costs, salaries and consummables and prefers to have his name on the building and be done with it. This creates a lot of white elephants that are not used.

## Maintenance

Once you have the infrastructure and the equipment you also need to have access to consummables and spare parts. This is often a problem in remote areas where the supply chain is not reliable. Brand new machines from international donors might end up in some shed because they are not maintained, there's no spare parts or the staff is not trained to use them.

Often medical equipment not being used can be because of trivial reasons like the machine is too noisy, there's no place to put it, the electrical system is not adapted, the instruction manual is not available in the local dialect, etc.

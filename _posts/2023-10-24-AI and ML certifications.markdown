I followed the different certifications on Coursera for AI and ML and really enjoy the work of AndrewNG which explains difficult concepts in a very simple way.

He also created the platform [Deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) which is a great resource for learning AI and ML.

Here are the different certifications I followed:

## Artifical intelligence and machine learning

- [Deep Learning Specialization (5 courses)](https://coursera.org/share/060c260c19a2007f337dfae390fe4382)
- Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
- Sequence Models
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Generative AI with Large Language Models
- Structuring Machine Learning Projects

## Quantum physics & Quantum computing

- Fundamentals of waves and vibrations
- Quantum Optics 1 : Single Photons
- Quantum Optics 2 - Two photons and more

## Mechanaical engineering

- Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design and Manufacturing with Fusion 360
- Modeling and Design for Mechanical Engineers with Autodesk Fusion 360
